## 💼 About the Project

**$BAG** is XRPL’s loudest meme — not because it promises utility, but because it already has it.  
It rides the $XRP rails. Fast, cheap, and built to move.  

The site exists to:
- Serve as the official launchpad for the token  
- Host OTC sales and drops  
- Broadcast $BAG’s identity to the chain

No empty promises. Just:  
**Built to flex. Powered by $XRP.**
