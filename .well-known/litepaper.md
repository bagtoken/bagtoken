1. Liquidity is seeded with $BAG + XRP  
2. Market activity drives price discovery  
3. Profits retained for strength  
4. Fresh liquidity added in the next reseed  
5. Cycle repeats — **100 times in total**  

**Impact:**  
- Creates stair-step price floors  
- Extends liquidity across long-term growth  
- Prevents short-term drain, builds lasting resilience

### 💧 Tiered Reseed Framework  
$BAG operates on a **tiered-down reseeding model** — each cycle group releases smaller tranches as supply tightens and value compounds.  

| Tier | Cycle Range | Reseed Size | Total Released | Supply % |
|:----:|:-------------|:------------|:----------------|:----------|
| **Tier 1 — Genesis** | 1 | 10 B | 10 B | 1 % |
| **Tier 2 — Early Growth** | 2–10 | 1 B each | 9 B | 0.9 % |
| **Tier 3 — Expansion** | 11–20 | 500 M each | 5 B | 0.5 % |
| **Tier 4 — Velocity** | 21–40 | 250 M each | 5 B | 0.5 % |
| **Tier 5 — Precision** | 41–70 | 100 M each | 3 B | 0.3 % |
| **Tier 6 — Legacy** | 71–90 | 50 M each | 1 B | 0.1 % |
| **Tier 7 — Final Phase** | 91–100 | 25 M each | 250 M | 0.025 % |

→ **Total = 100 cycles = ~33.25 B $BAG reseeded (≈ 3.3 % of total supply).**  
**The remaining ≈ 96.7 % stays in vaults, burns, or reserve control — fueling future rotations, Arcade Hub rewards, Duels, and Bag Drop mechanics.**

### 🏦 Post-Cycle Supply & Future Rotations  
After Cycle 100, $BAG transitions into the **Vault Era** — the remaining 96.7 % of supply becomes the backbone of long-term sustainability.  

#### 1️⃣ Vaulted Supply — *The Engine Room*  
**Initially allocated:** ≈ 700 B $BAG (70 %)  

- Fuels future **Rotations 2 – 10** and ecosystem growth  
- Serves as the main source for reseeds, giveaways, partnerships, and operational funding  
- **Dynamic balance:** decreases over time as tokens are used for Bag Drops, community rewards, and verified burns  

*Unlock Logic:*  
Each new rotation deploys a smaller % of the remaining vault balance.  
Example: Rotation 2 → 1.5 % of current vault; Rotation 3 → 1 %, etc.  
All movements remain publicly trackable and hash-verified.  

---

#### 2️⃣ Burned Supply — *The Scarcity Driver*  
**≈ 200 B $BAG (20 %)**  
- Permanent deflationary pressure  
- Used for game burns, jackpot events, and milestone rewards  
- Offsets any new reseed liquidity to keep net-neutral supply  

*Triggers:*  
Automatic burns on game fees, NFT sales, and milestone completions (e.g., every 10 reseeds = scheduled burn).  

---

#### 3️⃣ Recycled Supply — *The Flow Loop*  
**≈ 66.75 B $BAG (6.7 %)**  
- Acts as ecosystem fuel for Arcade Hub, Duels, and staking rewards  
- Distributed only via **proof-of-play** or **on-chain earning**  
- Excess volume routed back into burn vaults for deflation balance  

---

#### 📊 Supply Summary  

| Category | Allocation | Function | Release Trigger |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Vaulted** | ≈ 700 B (starting) | Future rotations, OTC, partnerships | Rotation unlocks |
| **Burned** | 200 B (20 %) | Scarcity, deflation, trust | Milestone burns |
| **Recycled** | 66.75 B (6.7 %) | Ecosystem earning fuel | Game/Arcade payouts |
| **Total Locked** | **≈ 966.75 B (96.7 %)** | — | — |

---

#### 🚀 Future Cycles  
After the first 100 reseeds:  
1. **Rotation 2** begins, drawing from the remaining Vaulted balance.  
2. **Recycled supply** powers utility-based earning.  
3. **Burned supply** continues compressing float and raising floors.  

Each rotation tightens supply, strengthens value, and pushes $BAG closer to deflationary status.
